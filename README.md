# PyCalculatorTkinter
Really little code, learning how to use Tkinter interface and sizeable geometry.

This Python script creates a graphical user interface (GUI) for a basic calculator using the Tkinter library. The calculator allows users to perform arithmetic calculations by clicking on buttons corresponding to numbers, operators, and parentheses. The result of the calculation is displayed in a text field at the top of the interface. The GUI is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with buttons laid out in a familiar manner similar to traditional calculators. Additionally, keyboard input is disabled to ensure consistency and prevent unintended input. The script provides a simple yet functional calculator interface suitable for educational purposes or basic calculations in everyday use.
An executable app is to be created...
